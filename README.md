**Sorting Algorithm Visualizer**

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer! This Python application allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action, helping you understand how they work step by step.

**Features**

- Visualize 8 different sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Counting Sort
  - Radix Sort
- Adjust array size and sorting speed
- Pause and resume sorting process
- Full-screen mode for better visibility

**Requirements**
To run this application, you'll need:
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

**Installation**

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.

**2. Use the interface to:**
   - Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu
   - Adjust the array size using the slider
   - Set the sorting speed with the speed slider
   - Click "Generate Array" to create a new random array
   - Click "Start Sorting" to begin the visualization
   - Use the "Pause" button to pause/resume the sorting process

3. Press the Escape key to exit full-screen mode.

**Understanding the Visualization**

- Blue bars represent unsorted elements
- Yellow bars show elements being compared or moved
- Green bars indicate sorted elements
